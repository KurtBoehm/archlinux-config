# 📘 Arch Linux Configuration Guide

This repository contains [a guide to installing Arch Linux](Installation.md), which I have developed over the course of installing Arch Linux many times.  
It focuses on the main situations I have installed Arch Linux in:

- CPU: Intel or AMD
- GPU: Built-in or NVIDIA
- Main Drive: NVMe SSD
- OS: Arch Linux only or dual-booted with Windows

### ⚙️ Configuration Files

Some configuration files that are copied to various places in the course of the post-installation, but can also be used independently, are included in the [`conf` sub-folder](conf/).  
CSS files for use in Obsidian are included in the [`obsidian` sub-folder](obsidian/).

> The Obsidian-related files are **not** used during post-installation and need to be copied to the appropriate folder of a given vault manually.

### 🔐 SSH Guide

A small guide for some SSH-related configuration tasks is included in [`SSH.md`](SSH.md), which is referenced during post-installation but is also useful in isolation.
